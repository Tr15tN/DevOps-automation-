## 📝 Notes

### Decisions Made

- **Cloud Provider**: GCP (for future project alignment)
- **VM Count**: Start with 1 (free tier), scale to 4-5 later
- **CI/CD Tool**: GitLab CI (aligns with future project)
- **Configuration Tool**: Ansible (simpler than Chef/Puppet)

### Challenges Overcome

- **Windows Path Issues**: Fixed SSH key path to use full Windows path
- **Terraform Functions**: Fixed `fileexists()` to use `try(file(), "")`
- **Authentication**: Set up gcloud application default credentials
- **Region Migration**: Migrated from us-central1 to europe-north1 (destroyed and recreated VM)
- **Ansible on Windows**: Switched to WSL due to Windows compatibility issues
- **SSH Key Permissions**: Fixed WSL permissions (copied key to WSL home, set 600)
- **Ansible Module Issues**: Fixed docker_compose_v2 module (switched to shell command)
- **Docker Group Issue**: Removed docker group from common.yml (added in docker.yml instead)
- **File Path Issues**: Fixed Ansible file paths using `{{ playbook_dir }}/../../`
- **Health Check Issues**: Fixed nginx health checks (process check instead of wget)
- **Template Escaping**: Fixed Ansible template variables in docker ps command

### Lessons Learned

- Terraform on Windows requires full paths (no `~` expansion)
- GCP free tier is generous (1 VM free forever)
- Infrastructure as Code makes everything reproducible
